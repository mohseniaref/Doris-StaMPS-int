These scripts enable the usage of StaMPS for Sentinel-1 datasets by interferogram formation using Doris. Currently only PS Processing is implemented in these scripts thus the Small Baseline Processing will not be possible without further modification.

At the moment of writing, the new version of DORIS (v5) is about to be published allowing for Sentinel-1 interferogram formation. This may result in alterations of the current processing structure, possibly making the current scripts unable to function. Furthermore the scripts have not been thoroughly tested and may need a revision or two.
